custom Youtube video to mp3 converter
### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction 

Hello World! 

I am working on recording videos and needed audio files from Youtube videos.
I could use Youtube to mp3 conversion service sites... but I am a programmer. 
So I went ahead and created a simple script to download Youtube audios straight from Youtube.

### ðŸ“‘ How to Install and Run

The installation requirements for this python script is 
- python 3
- pafy
- youtube-dl

Once you have python 3 downloaded, follow the instructions below.

1. Clone the repo in your desired location.
2. Run the Powershell commands in the run.txt in order.
3. Download the video.

# Things to Note 
- The videos will be downloaded to your repo location only. pafy only allows downloads in your current path where the script is being run from.
- If you are using virtual env, remember to activate and deactivate the env.
