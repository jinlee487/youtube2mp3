custom Youtube video to mp3 converter 2.00
### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction 

Hello World! 

I was working on recording videos and needed audio clips from Youtube.
I could use Youtube to mp3 conversion service sites... but I am a programmer. 
So I went ahead and created a simple script to download Youtube audios straight from Youtube.
This Python script uses Tkinter for the GUI design and pafy to download youtube streams.

Please message me with any feedback, I am happy to listen :)

### ðŸ“‘ How to Install and Run

1. Download the youtube2mp3 2.00 zip file from the lastest published releases.
2. After you first download the zip folder, unzip the folder in your location of choice.
3. Then create a quick a shortcut of the youtube2mp3.exe file for access.
4. Make sure to choose a file download destination before you start downloading files.
5. Start downloading
### ðŸ“‘ Things to Note 

- The videos will be downloaded to your repo location only. pafy only allows downloads in your current path where the script is being run from.
- If you are using virtual env, remember to activate and deactivate the env.
- I recommand you download m4a files instead of WebM files.
- M4A files are encoded with the lossy Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec,
- which is able to provide the same bitrates as MP3s, yet achieve tighter compression.
- This results in smaller file sizes, all while delivering higher audio quality.
- YouTube supports the following video formats for upload: 
- 3GPP, AVI, FLV, MOV, MPEG4, MPEGPS, WebM and WMV. 
- MPEG4 commonly uses the . mp4 file extension.
