After you first download the zip folder, unzip the folder in your location of choice.
Then create a quick a shortcut of the youtube2mp3.exe file for access.
Make sure to choose a file download destination before you start downloading files.
I recommend you download m4a files instead of WebM files.

M4A files are encoded with the lossy Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec,
which is able to provide the same bitrates as MP3s, yet achieve tighter compression.
This results in smaller file sizes, all while delivering higher audio quality.
YouTube supports the following video formats for upload: 
3GPP, AVI, FLV, MOV, MPEG4, MPEGPS, WebM and WMV. 
MPEG4 commonly uses the . mp4 file extension. 
YouTube also recommends specific encoding settings for optimal conversion.

This is an open source youtube audio/video downloader made by me, Jinlee487. 
I will not assume any responsibility of others using this resource in any fashion.

Enjoy!!
